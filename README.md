## art-portfolio project
This is my first React project after completing a simple to-do app tutorial. The project features different pages for viewing different kinds of work such as photo vs. video. <br />

The coolest part of the project is the Map page where I utilized the Google Maps Javascript API and the google-map-react package to display a custom styled Google Map with location markers that the site visitor can click on to view photos I have taken at that location. Inspiration for this page came from Instagram's photo map feature that has long been removed. The Map Page was originally meant to be the entirety of the project because I wanted a unique way to display my work as opposed to using Squarespace or something :) <br />

The Video page is loosely based off of Youtube's site layout with a main video player on the right-hand side and a selection of thumbnails for other videos on the left-hand side. <br />

The Photo page utilizes filters that update what kinds of photos are displayed in real-time. <br />
